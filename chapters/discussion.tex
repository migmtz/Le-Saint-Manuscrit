\chapter{Discussion}

% {Idea 1 (simple):}
% \begin{itemize}
%     \item Contributions part by part, chapter by chapter with insistence on questions asked before
%     \item Perspectives in bullet points
% \end{itemize}

\textbf{Idea 2 (similar but less scholar):}
\begin{itemize}
    \item A short explanation of thesis goals and achievements
    \item First half contributions and perspectives
    \item Second half contributions and perpectives
\end{itemize}


% \textbf{Idea 3 (very scholar):}
% \begin{itemize}
%     \item Chapter by chapter summaries of contributions
%     \item Chapter by chapter perspectives
% \end{itemize}


EXTENSIONS:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Other models for inhibition ? %positive part, better with others (and link with theoretical properties) but harder as implementation
    \item Study theoretical properties of our models and estimators (identifiability, consistency, asymptotic normality)
    
    \item Study other kernels and non-parametric settings through our approaches
    
    \item Lasso penalisation for multivariate interaction matrix estimation
    \item Evaluation methods and model selection through cross-validation thanks to spectral 
    
    \item (Lien entre deux) Faux pos Faux neg (like in epidemics, combine both could help to model this dynamics)
    %\item Applicaition links with spectral
    %\item Prediciton ?? (maybe too small )
\end{itemize}
